This little program gets some txt file (book for example) and counts each word in it.
After this processing program creates file out.txt with each word and number of repetitions.

It's kinda top words in any book :)

Steps to use:

1. Open main.py
2. Type filename and press enter(you can use "harryPotter1.txt" in this folder or other file) 
3. Process will take some time and will give you success message
4. Optional ways:
  - You can just open out.txt but it's without any filter
  - For example you can grab all text and put it to Gsheet for filtering :)
  

p.s. I learned English then and the idea was to get top english words to learn :P
