Simple socket chat in console.

Created while I learned sockets in Python.

Program contains server.py and client.py.

server.py is a server (awesome!) who gets information about new connected clients.
It's working on localhost and required to add IP Address.
Of course you can forward your local IP Address using port forwarding and use it in Internet
But you should reconfigure client.py to valid IP address to connect

client.py connecting to IP address, asks about your Nickname and that's it. You can use it on your own.
Not so safety. Not so good. But it works :)

Of course it's not a very very good product. It's just example how can we use sockets in Python. :)
